# jinja-swap-braces
A small library for swapping "{" and "{{", to be used with Jinja2.

This is primarily useful if you want to use jinja2 templates to make dynamic
notes in ipython notebook. I use this to help me remember how to do tasks that
might be ~15-30% different each time. These templates can take a small number
of parameters and generate a sequence of commands or a few sample config or code
files, or both.
